## [Solution](https://leetcode.cn/problems/koko-eating-bananas/description/)

```java
class Solution {
    public int minEatingSpeed(int[] piles, int h) {
        /**
        二分法 寻找可可吃香蕉的速度
        最小1 最大 10^9
        return value: the shortest time of eating all bananes
        question: how to calculate shortest time of eating bananes;
        piles[i] / speed
        what is speed? we hvae a range from 1 to 10^9
        so using binary search to find the speed that kek can ea banaes as slow as posiible
        what is our target hours like time to eat all banane? its h.
        when we find out the target? we are not sure the speed is optimal. we use leftbound to make sure the answer is optimal

                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1; // eat too slow

        for (int pile : piles) {
            hours += (pile + speed - 1) / speed; // 小技巧 计算当前速度下需要的总小时数
        }

        return hours;
